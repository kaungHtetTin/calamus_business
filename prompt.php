I have made some changes in promotion_codes table.

changing the table name to     partner_earnings.
dropping the columns: expired_at, code
changing the status column data to 'pending', 'paid',

What is your take on this?
You need to remove the promotion code managment system.

Update the earning history page to use the new table.
