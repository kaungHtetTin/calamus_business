I added some columns to partners table:
(Address Information)
address
city
state
(National ID Card Information)
national_id_card_number
national_id_card_front_image
national_id_card_back_image

make a form for the user to fill out the address information and the national id card information and save it to the database 
in profile settings page

if a new partner is created, the address information and the national id card information should be saved to the database
or show the warning message to the user to fill out the address information and the national id card information in the dashboard
'Please fill out the address information and the national id card information. Otherwise, you will not be able to receive payments.'
