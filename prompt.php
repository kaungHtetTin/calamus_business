I want to make @index.php  page into welcome page. 
This page will be the first page that the user sees when they visit the website.
Theme is the same as the business website.
I want to add navbar with logo and links to login and register.
No sidebar navigation.
I want to add cover section with a background image and a title and a description and a button to register.
The background image should be a full width image.
under cover section, I want to add the introduction of the business with a title and a description.
I want to add footer with links to about, contact, terms of service, and privacy policy.
